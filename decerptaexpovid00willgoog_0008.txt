WE whose names ste suhserihed heve exmined the
lollorring extracto from Orid's Metamorphoses, end
think them judiciously selected, sndwell sdtpted topro-
mute the pmgress of the classicul student. The English
editor sppesrs to have been amful to exclude sny inde·
liceto expressions or sentimentn whieh might hare e
tendency to injure the mortls of youth. This snssll ro·
lumo contains ss much ol Ovid's Metsmorphoses ss is
usually read at school; und we heg leave to recommend
it to ull tetchers ol Lutin throughout the United states.

We approve the plan of short explanatory notes in
English. Long notet iu lustin tre not usoiul toboys,

besam they are not easily understood, end therefore'sro
seldom reud.
